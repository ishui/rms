            Interface for annotations which can be rendered on a chart.

            <remarks>
            <p class="body">
            A custom object implementing IAnnotation can be added to
            an UltraChart's Annotations collection, and thus be
            rendered on a chart like any other type of annotation
            object.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
            Alternatively, an IAnnotation object's RenderAnnotation method can be
            called from a custom layer, which would cause it to be
            rendered to the SceneGraph using the specified parameters
            for location.

            <p class="body">
            This overload of the RenderAnnotation method will be called by the Annotation Layer when an annotation's Location
            has matched with a parent primitive.  For example, if the annotation's Row and Column
            are the same as another primitive's, a parent primitive has been found for the annotation,

            If multiple parent matches have been found for a single annotation, for example if the annotation

When the underlying bar or column comes into contact with a near or far axis, rendering the label could cause it to appear outside the grid (region between axes).  In these cases the label will be clipped, and the appropriate alignment property should be adjusted to make the chart text label visible.</ul>
            <ul>When the format string set in <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance.ItemFormatString"/> is unrecognized or does not apply to the current chart type, a partial or empty label may render.  For instance, applying the &lt;DATA_VALUE_Z&gt; keyword that is applicable in a bubble chart context to chart text appearing on a two-dimensional line chart (having only X and Y data values) will cause an empty string to be rendered.</ul>
            <ul>A chart text label may be temporarily concealed by highlighting if the label appears inside a graphical element and the highlight is opaque.</ul>
            <ul>The <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartTextAppearance.FontColor"/> is the same, or close to, the background color of the chart.</ul>

            <p class="body">Since types in .NET vary on culture, two types having the same name with different cultures are distinct types.  Make sure that when converting types the culture argument to this method matches the culture of the Infragistics assemblies installed on the machine.</p>
            <p class="body">Additionally, the method requires that the chartText parameter be of type ChartTextAppearance. The destinationType must be of type InstanceDescriptor.  If either of these criteria are not met, then this method falls back on the base class implementation, if any.</p>

            <remarks>
            <p class="body">The control supports a variety of data source types.</p>
            <p class="body">The most robust and extensible data source is the <a href="ms-help://MS.NETFrameworkSDK/cpref/html/frlrfSystemDataDataTableClassTopic.htm">DataTable</a>, which provides update notifications via the <a href="ms-help://MS.NETFrameworkSDK/cpref/html/frlrfSystemComponentModelIBindingListClassTopic.htm">IBindingList</a> interface.  Use of these built-in ADO.NET data management types offers the greatest flexibility.</p>
            <p class="body">Many charts also support data-binding to ICollections (including simple arrays) provided the a single-typed, one-dimensional array can meet the chart type's Data Requirements.  Chartable data sources include custom ICollections, and custom data objects that additionally support IBindingList may take advantage of live data-binding to the chart component.</p>
            <p class="body">Another data source that may be provided is the local filename of an XML or comma-delimited text file.</p>
            <p class="body">XML documents require an internal XML Schema document, and must be readily mappable to the Framework's DataSet (their <b>msdata:IsDataSet</b> attribute is set to <i>true</i>).  The schema is also necessary since each XML element must be strongly-typed (otherwise their data type will be inferred as <b>xsd:string</b> and this will not translate readily into a DataSet, even though the data content of the element may be numeric.)  Please see <a href="ms-help://MS.NETFrameworkSDK/cpguidenf/html/_generating_dataset_relational_structure_from_xsd.htm">Generating DataSet Relational Structure from XML Schema</a> in the .NET Framework documentation for more on the issues involved, and consult the samples included with this product for working schema.</p>

            <p class="body">This property does not apply to non-numeric (for instance, axes based on dates or discrete item labels) or non-continuous axes (for instance, logarithmic axes for which <i>log 0</i> is mathematically undefined).</p>
            <p class="body">Developers can use this feature when they want their minimum data values to display and showing the axis at the origin is relevant.  When there is little variation between data values (<i>i.e.</i>, the difference between the maximum and minimum values being charted is small compared to the minimum value's difference from the zero-axis), it is a better choice to adjust the RangeAxisType to Custom on the <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.AxisAppearance"/> and set the RangeMin and RangeMax properties instead of using zero-alignment.</p>

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">Enables drill down functionality in UltraChart.
            Before drill down can be fully realized, the DrillElement property must
            be initialized with an array of DrillElements that describe the drill
            down hierarchy.</p>
            <p class="body">For all WebCharts and WinCharts with custom Drill Down (IDrillDown) implemented,
            this property will have no effect.  To disable Drill Down in a custom IDrillDown implementation,
            avoid calling your custom Drill method in the ChartDataClicked event handler.</p>

        <member name="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DrillDownAppearance.ShowButton">
            <summary>
            Activates a small button in the upper-left corner of a Chart's area that automatically drills back.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">When active, a drill back button is automatically displayed at the top-left corner of the chart grid (it may appear outside of Pie and Doughnut charts since they have no upper-right corner).  It appears behind graphed objects when those objects are highlighted.  It isn't possible to relocate this button, and it is not shown by default.</p>
            <p class="body">As an alternative to using ShowButton, developers can provide their own Button or user interface experience to control drill back.  The UltraChart class exposes a DrillBack() method that can be called by application logic (such as in an ClickEvent handler).</p> 
            <p class="body">Whether the user navigates up the drill down hierarchy using the provided button or an application generated DrillBack() call, the effect of returning to the parent chart is the same.  Since this button does not appear, it is incumbent upon developers to either turn on ShowButton or provide their own DrillBack() call to enable users to revisit parent charts.</p>

        <member name="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DrillDownAppearance.Depth">
            <summary>
            Depth in the drill down hierarchy, measured from the topmost chart.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">This property returns the depth (or "drilled level") in the drill down hierarchy of the currently displayed child chart.  Each time a user drills down, depth (their distance from the topmost chart) increases by one level.  Calling the <see cref="M:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DrillDownAppearance.DrillBack"/>() method or using the drill back button (see the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DrillDownAppearance.ShowButton"/> property), both reduce the depth by one level.</p>
            <p class="body">Depth is read-only. It cannot be directly modified to skip several levels in the drill down hierarchy.  It is possible to have multiple <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.DrillElement"/> objects refer to equivalent child charts (identical <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Shared.Styles.ChartType"/>s and <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.DataAppearance.DataSource">DataSource</see>s), even at different depths in the drill down hierarchy, thereby simulating the appearance of diving several levels at once.</p>

            An Appearance object describing the style for Axis Gridlines (major and minor).
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">Gridlines come in two types: major and minor.  They appear alternating in two-dimensional chart grids by default, based on the major and minor tickmark intervals.  Developers should design the style of minor gridlines to be more subtle than that applied to major gridlines, if minor gridlines are used at all.  Each <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.AxisAppearance"/> is associated with a pair of GridlinesAppearance objects.</p>
            <p class="body">Gridlines automatically scroll and scale in conjunction with the current scrollbar position, and usually have a fixed correspondence to axis labels, if labels appear.  Labels may not always correspond to gridlines if custom keywords are used and some tickmarks are therefore not labeled by a charting application's design.</p>
            <p class="body">Gridlines are always rendered perpendicular to their parent axis.</p>
            <p class="body">This appearance object only supports the customizability of 2-D Charts' gridlines.</p>

            <remarks>
            <p class="body"><see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Core.Primitives.Primitive">Primitves</see> and certain <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ChartAppearance">ChartAppearance</see> subclasses that expose properties with sophisticated filling features use PaintElement objects to describe the characteristics of how they are filled and outlined.  This type encapsulates those methods and properties developers may already expect from Brush (fill) and Pen (stroke) objects in other GUI environments.</p>
            <p class="body">PaintElement objects are only applicable to objects that support all of the following sophisticated filling techniques:</p>
            <li><ul>Solid fills.</ul><ul>Tiled texture fills.</ul><ul>Gradient fills.</ul><ul>Hatch pattern fills.</ul></li>
            <p class="body">Appearance objects that don't require PaintElement's broad support will only expose a fill or background color property (and possibly border color and thickness properties) for solid fills only.</p>

            <remarks>
            <p class="body">This method converts objects of <see cref="T:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.PaintElement"/> into InstanceDescriptor objects that are used during serialization and for the design-time environment.  Call the <see cref="M:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.PaintElementConverter.CanConvertTo(System.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext,System.Type)"/> method to ascertain whether conversion between two Types is supported.</p>
            <p class="body">Since types in .NET vary on culture, two types having the same name with different cultures are distinct types.  Make sure that when converting types the culture argument to this method matches the culture of the Infragistics assemblies installed on the machine.</p>
            <p class="body">Additionally, the method requires that the paintItem parameter be of type PaintElement. The destinationType must be of type InstanceDescriptor.  If either of these criteria are not met, then this method falls back on the base class implementation, if any.</p>

Connecting lines can also be subject to smoothing through spline fitting with the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ScatterChartAppearance.LineAppearance">LineAppearance</see> property.</p>
            <p class="body">There are a variety of symbols that can be used to plot scatter points, including shapes and Unicode glyphs.

See the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ScatterChartAppearance.Icon"/> and <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.ScatterChartAppearance.Character"/> properties for more details on the selection of symbols.</p>

            An Appearance object controlling the user's perspective on 3-D charts.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <p class="body">Developers can set properties on this Appearance object at design-time or run-time to alter the vantage point a user has when examining a three-dimensional chart, including specifying the <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.View3DAppearance.XRotation"/>, <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.View3DAppearance.YRotation"/> and/or <see cref="P:Infragistics.UltraChart.Resources.Appearance.View3DAppearance.ZRotation"/> around each of the three axes.</p>
            <p class="body">Three-dimensional charts are displayed in a 3-D chart grid area, with XY, XZ and YZ backplanes and a clear frontal view.  Using this class, developers may rotate a chart such that the user is looking at it through a backplane (ie, from behind or underneath the chart grid).  The result of such viewing angles are undefined.  Instead of rotating behind the chart grid, developers should re-orient the data plotted in the 3-D chart to bring background elements to the front for the user to examine.</p>
            <p class="body">End users may rotate and revolve charts (in UltraWinChart only) at run-time by holding down the ALT-key on the keyboard and dragging the mouse.  Developers can disable this by intercepting and terminating mouse events when the ALT-key is depressed.</p>

            <p class="body">For these purposes, developers will find it necessary to set (at minimum) the DrillElement's ID property (identifying what data element on a parent chart will be drillable), its Data source (identifying where information comes from to populate the child chart drilled to), and the chart type (of the child chart).</p>
